	<p>This page will contain various study resources for select Purdue mathematics courses.</p>
	<p>The practice problems provided for each course are designed to challenge your understanding of the topics at hand. 
	They aren't necessarily long in length (although some can get a little hairy), but they will likely be more exotic than what
	would appear on your homework.</p>
